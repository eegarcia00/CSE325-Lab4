	A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered

	Some of the major difficulties I encountered were in thread_exit and mutex lock functions. 
	In thread_exit I was unable to exit without deallocating the page table of the entire process. 
 	It wasn’t until I met up with Keaton again that he suggested to comment out the close all open 
	files for loop as well as begin_op and end_op. In the mutex lock I found it difficult to acquire 
	and release the lock properly. Wasn’t sure how to implement the sleep(1) suggestion in the lab pdf. 
	In the end we ended solving all of our issues the code runs well.
