ESTIMATE of time to complete lab: 5 hours

		Start	Time	Lab
Date	Time	Spent	Part Work Completed
--------------------------------------------
10/05   11:00	1:00	Read assignment, defined thread syscalls but no logic.
10/10	13:00   1:00	created logic for thread syscalls and tested against threads.c.
10/11   17:30   2:00    went over lab with Eric and talked about what each of us were to do.
10/24	12:00   2:00    created mutex lock(both definitions and logic) and tested against threads.c
10/24   17:00	1:30    went over final adjustments....README....and lab submission.

DISCUSSION:

In this lab the only challenging task to me was implementing thread_create. It was a little more challenging
to determine which parts of the process table should be copied and which parts should be created new.
After figuring out how to create a thread the rest of the lap almost represented wait() exit() entirely besides
a few tweaks.
mutex locks were a little tricky to get the atomic instructions setup, after analyzing spinlock() we were table
to modify our lock atomically.
